Dry, though fruity taste with roses, strawberries, hints of pleasant bitterness and minerals at the finish.,Fine but not in the same league as the Tempier.

Wonderful long finish.,And I'm back on the sweet stiff again, thank God they come in halves. Nose - Classic pronounced marmalade orange rind, with that lovely sour-ness to balance the sweetness, petroly and heady. Punchy topical fruit (guava etc). Palate - Lots more marmalade, but with a creaminess, toastiness and a butteriness - literally like butter and old school marmalade on toast. Tart bitterness of the orange cuts through the sweetness. Full body, but balanced and not heavy due to this. Finish - Orange rind all the way.,This is quite a light dessert wine and not overly sweet. It has the usual tastes of honeysuckle, apricot and peach but also there is almond at the end. As it's not too syrupy, it is a good one to have on stock and it doesn't need an overly rich dessert next to it. Personally I would prefer it to be slightly more viscous and sweet but it's still very good."

Lovely wine, with heady aromas of dark toffee, antique wood, furniture polish, orange rind, apricot, coffee. Long palate adds hazelnut and bright citrus acidity. Palo cortado is made from sherry destined to be fino, but where the flor does not establish itself.

A top NZ SB for the money.,4.2 This wine is a very special NZ SB. 2020 vintage. Obvious citrus notes, with green apple, lime, honey, and passion fruit. and then very subtle floral notes (from NZ SB??), finishing with grass notes on the palate. Not acidic at all, which is a fantastic point that I like. There are NZ SBs that are too acidic to an extent that it disturbs the overall tasting experience. But Mount Riley shows very much controlled acidity, with elegant and diverse characters thru the nose. After trying 20+ SBs.. wow..,I‚Äôve written about this wine before. It‚Äôs an excellent example of NZ winemaking at its heart: complex and well-developed, yet still affordable and not overly serious. If you‚Äôre looking for a tart, citric Marlborough SB, this one‚Äôs a great choice."

Light melon ribs and honey dew on the nose with a soft citrus with nice acidity. The palate offers OS X pear with a slight lemon peel.

It was especially good with Salmon Sushi.,On the nose lots of strawberry and raspberry, some kirsberry, lingonberry and mint/citrus. The palate is very fruity with a nice mix of red fruits including a nice balance with prominent tannins, probably due to the 60% level of Grenache. Definitely a Ros√© in my taste, love this!

Lots going on with the palate - what I think of as a pleasantly high-toned aged note, with great structure and a smooth finish with medium grip at the very tail and a menthol linger. Brooding, but soft at the same time.,Bouquet reminiscent of Sangiovese that starts with a dry, softly tanic tounge with a whisp of dark fruit that finishes with a touch of acidity higher than appropriate, although this can be successfully managed by either decanting or oxidation.,Very good. Still young, with active tannins (give it another 5 years and this will be at its prime). Needs time to open up, but quite impressive and complex. Quite rounded. Black cherry, red currant jam, tar, turmeric/ cardamom, black truffle, dark chocolate. Medium to full body, long finish."

Although a touch less viscous, that does not mean a dip in quality. This '11, to me, showed more intense flavors with a little less sweetness. With that, it still tasted a little tightly wound, but time in the cellar should prove beneficial to acid and sugar integration. An inexpensive but solid wine for the price.,Very good sweet wine, with noble rot used as the sweetener. Aromas of raisin, sultana, marmalade, honey and mushroom. These scents develop further with stone fruits and dry fruits on the palate. Nice medium plus finish.,This is an interesting vintage, 2011. Great acidity and alcohol, not so sweet.

This is quite something on the nose - spiced apple and a touch of smoke. On the palate, this is a full bodied wine, with a lush mouth feel. There's some real depth and complexity to this - buttery oak notes, apple and honey.

Utterly mouth coating and sumptuous, long, great fruit and with amazing clean acidity to finish. Absolute cracker!,Delicious if not a little light. Lacking the slightly trufflier element that I love in great Sauternes. But this had all the caramel and toffee apple that we love.

Fonseca,10 Year Old Tawny Port N.V.,Fortified Wine,Portugal,4.0,2590,,"Tinta Amarela, Tempranillo, Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz, Tinta Barroca",20,"One of the best 10 year old Tawny Ports in my humble opinion. It has a lovely balance of dark rich fruit and toasty, smoky caramelised soft dark sugar. The sweetness and higher acidity work well. It comes in handy 500ml bottles, and it tells you the year it was bottled on the label, so you know it hasn't been sat under lights in the shop for 5 years. Simple things! I've never been disappointed with a bottle of port from Fonseca, a really top class producer. Port season is back!,A very good 10 year aged tawny, from the famous Fonseca estate. Great to find a series of them at a tasting. Chapeau to Wittebol! Rich flavored with dried fruits, spices, a nutty impression too. On the palate fresh and balanced. Very good.

Nose is 5 stars, complex explosion of fruits ranging from watermelon, apricot and strawberry, paired with soft flowery notes. A wine perfume that excites the senses. Loses some of its complexity on the mouth due to some degree of minerality, which is why I gave it 4.5 stars overall, but nonetheless a truly great sample from the land of Ros√®.,4.2/5 Hallmarked by pleasure freshness from fresh minerality in a rainy day and citrus grapefruit with solid structure from medium plus acidity and subtle red fruits (particularly wild strawberry). Aromas originated from white flowers aromas are intense and lingering. Slight saline, grassy, and savory dairy product flavours boost up its complexity. This is the reliable example of high-quality Provence rose. Paired well with diverse foods on the table."
