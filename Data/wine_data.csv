The bubbles are sufficient to keep your palate entertained & the pour is gorgeous for any champagne occasion. It‚Äôs not overly sweet either,For the concept, this is lovely. We all enjoyed it much more than expected. Light on the alcohol at 6%. Take the bottle‚Äôs suggestion to shake softly before serving. We didn‚Äôt notice that and ended up with some chunky mango at the bottom of the bottle that plopped out in the last glasses poured. The real fruit here makes the difference over artificially flavored alcohols. This hits a refreshing note, with the ripeness of the mango apparent but without being overly sweet.

Citrus and slightly floral. Taste: raisins, fig, more orange and grapefruit, tan and leather. Very savoury for a rose from Cotes du Provence. Finish: this is where this wine comes into its own. Plenty of smooth rounded tannins, a great balance of acidity and sweetness and an everlasting length to the finish. A great wine that‚Äôs on offer at Waitrose and makes it very reasonable"

It has the juicy-ness of the Zinfandel, the masculinity of the Merlot, and the strength of the Petite Sirah.,What a blend. Fruity and powerful on the pallet, strong slightly dry finish that leave your wanting more."
Joseph Phelps,Sauvignon Blanc 2018,White wine,United States,4.2,176,33.99,100% Sauvignon Blanc,13.5,"Light golden hue with citrus notes on the nose mixing with tart apple on the palate with a hint of vanilla sweetness on the finish. Very fresh SB,Fantastic white wine. Beautiful golden hay color. Notes if green apples lemongrass, melon, lemon zest, and yeast. Good firm firm tannins with great acidity.,4.3 A top tier Napa SB no doubt. Bright golden color. Blueberry, vanilla and soft, ripe pineapple. Deep complexity and balance. White roses and full bodied. ABV - 13.5%"
Scribe,Sylvaner 2019,White wine,United States,4.2,68,36.99,100% Sylvaner,,"My first Sylvaner!! And far from Germany, as this one hails from Sonoma, from the 1 acre planted in the state of California. Thanks Trey Williams for this geeky find! Color of pale straw. Inviting nose of pear, biscuit, honeydew melon, kiwi, and cucumber. Crisp light juicy mouthfeel with med acidity. Palate agrees with the nose completely with the addition of white floral. A delicious juicy white!,4.2/5. A gorgeous wine that just came on 2 days ago from a club shipment. Thank god. Pale straw. Nose screams tropical fruit, pear, and wet stone. More complex than it lets on. Medium acidity and body is light. Stone fruit with lemon as well as loads of bracing minerality that I adore. Finish is crisp but lingers with notes of lemon and saline. Exceptional wine, especially given this is the only acre planted to Sylvaner in CA (per report). Grab a bottle for an aperitif or a warm weather quaff.,Green apple straw pear lemon"
Louis de Grenelle,Peche Imperiale N.V.,Sparkling wine,France,4.1,99,13.99,100% Chenin Blanc,,"It's just peachy,Interesting yet fun bubbly from the Loire! I‚Äôm not a big fan of tampering with flavors. They added ‚Äúnatural and artificial flavors.‚Äù But, it works with this one. I found it enjoyable. Made in the traditional method, unsure of the grapes. The peach flavor is subtle in this off dry juice. Soft slightly coarse bubbles with med persistence. Flavors of peach üòâ, apple, lime, and a hint of shortbread. A great party wine if you‚Äôre up for supporting the tampering....,You are a bit hungover and want to delay your headache. You are out of OJ but you have a bottle of this in the fridge. Mission accomplished."
Gran Moraine,Pinot Noir 2018,Red wine,United States,4.3,144,45,100% Pinot Noir,13.5,"Wonderful intensity with cola and black cherry notes. The smooth and lush mouthfeel gains complexity from a touch black pepper and smooth, polished tannis.,This is a wonderful Pinot. Extremely deep ruby in color. Mushroom, leather, and cherry on the nose. Cherry, strawberry, pepper and a touch of cola on the tongue. Quite easy to drink and can stand up to a wide variety of foods. Would definitely buy again.,1.5-hour decant. Medium ruby color. Nice nose of cherry, plum, oak, lavender & a hint of sassafras. In the mouth: plum & strong tea with medium acid & moderate tannins. Long fruit & tea finish. ABV 13.5%. Whole cluster 20%, cold mac 5-10 days, ferment 2-4 wks with manual punch down. 10 mos in French oak (43% new). 4.2-4.3‚≠êÔ∏è from me. Quite good. $35 locally."

Schloss Gobelsburg,Cistercien Ros√© 2019,Ros√© wine,Austria,4.1,310,13.99,100% Zweigelt,,"Year after year, this Austrian screw cap gem is clean and precise with a pretty (in) pink color, a (very) slight effervescence, aroma of melon, and citrus and watermelon going down the hatch.,A fantastic ros√©, an exemplar of everything you would want out of a classic style of ros√©! Pinot, Zweigelt, and St. Laurent. Light bodied, red fruit with strawberries and raspberries, solid medium plus acid, minerality on the nose and finish. Pairs with pool sides, patios, and with taking moments to contemplate who your role models are. Who are they, and why, and if you look up to them so, how can you act in ways befitting of those very qualities you look up to?,Selection to start off the night with Krista at the Oven Cellar with my favorite Sommelier, Charlie, 7/9/2020. Named Cistercien as made in old monastery. Blend of Zwiegelt, Pinot Noir & St. Laurent. Grapes are softly pressed and fermented still with the stems. No acid reduction is used to emphasize the fine fruity character with a streamlined elegance, similar to a white wine. Fragrance and fruit nuances of wild cherry and fresh berries make this ros√© an optimal universal food companion. $8 glass"
Lioco,Indica Ros√© 2017,Ros√© wine,United States,4.0,29,24,"Grenache, Mourvedre, Carignan",,"Dry, cherry notes. Easily drinkable.,Absolutely beautiful color and clarity. There‚Äôs a special quality to the look of the wine in the glass. The nose is not as forthcoming and is reminiscent of citrus and stone fruit. It‚Äôs dry, and meant to be as the label explains the vinification process in depth. Grapefruit and a hint some stone fruit come to mind. It has a rather nice mouth feel and some body. This wine will pair well with fish, even a salmon or tuna. Quite nice.,I found this Rose‚Äô to be quite special. The notes promote a jolly rancher nose but I find that a bit misleading. Yes the watermelon was there as well as the strawberry. But it had no sweetness to the taste. Truly ideal rose‚Äô"

In lieu of a solid dessert, this sweet dessert wine surely replaces most solid desserts. Beautiful brilliant 14k gold color. A nose with honey, apricot, and almond. The palate is smoooooth, unctuous with the flavors of honey with delicate nectarine or citrus. Yummy."

This was a blend of Pt and Gros Manseng - two varieties I don‚Äôt claim to know well - that the Sommelier pulled out of the bag to pair with a pear and verbena dessert. No notes taken but as I recall, mighty tasty and a great foil to the pudding. My sort of dessert wine as by no means as sweet as many. Orange and pineapple notes dominant. Liberal streak of acidity. Long finish.,third time I have had one of this lady‚Äôs wines .. this late harvest halfway between wonderful sweet and dry takes on Juran√ßon. Not super sweet for a late harvest. 12%.
